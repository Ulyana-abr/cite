Laboratory work is a small scientific research work, which should be executed according to all approved requirements. When preparing a lab report, you will master a number of important elements that will be useful to you in the future when writing term papers and theses.

The structure of the report According to GOST 7.32-2001, any scientific research work must necessarily contain the following elements:

*    The title page
*    report
*    introduction
*    the main part
*    conclusion

GOST also recommends that the following elements be included in the work::

    list of performers
    content
    regulatory references
    definitions
    designations and abbreviations
    list of used application sources

If you are carrying out complex work performed in several stages, then you may need to include some or all of the elements of the second list in the work.

The content of the main elements of the report:

The title page. The first sheet of work is drawn up strictly according to the pattern that is usually given in the manuals on your subject. It not only requires specifying elements such as the name of the educational institution, type of work, and information about the performer, but also arranging them in strict accordance with the standards.

Report. The abstract is actually a summary of your entire report and contains a number of statistical information. It should specify the number of parts, pages of the work, illustrations, appendices, tables, used literary sources and appendices. The list of keywords of the paper and the actual text of the abstract are also provided here. The latter implies the main elements of the work, from the goals set to the results and recommendations for their implementation. In the practice of universities, an abstract is usually not included in laboratory reports.

Introduction. In the introduction of a typical laboratory work, the goals of the research and the tasks that will help achieve the goals are usually prescribed. At the same time, there are works in which students become real pioneers. Have you ever felt a sense of extreme curiosity and impatience when doing laboratory work? Do you feel that in just a couple of minutes you will find the answer to a question that no one has ever found an answer to? It is for such studies that a detailed introduction is written to prove the relevance and novelty of the topic being studied. In order to really conduct research in an area in which, as they say, no human has ever set foot, in the introduction you will need to provide an assessment of the current state of the problem under consideration and justify the need to solve it.

The main part. Since different universities and disciplines have their own subtleties of conducting laboratory work, the content of the main part is described in detail in the relevant manuals. It is important that this section of the work reflects its essence, describes the methodology and results of the work done.

The main part prescribes the following elements:

    objectives of the study;
    tasks that will help you achieve your goals;
    the progress of the work, which describes the actions performed;
    other sections provided by the methodological materials on the discipline under study.

Conclusion. In this part of the work, you will need to draw conclusions from the results obtained during the laboratory work. To do this, evaluate how fully the tasks have been completed. Other elements may be present in complex work, for example, recommendations for further application of the results of the work performed.
